## Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression
I used logistic regression to determine if the diagnosis is M or B (malignant or benign) by analysing other physical attributions of the person. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/logistic-reg-breast-cancer-detection" target="_blank">Visit Kaggle</a>


| Code and Resources Used  | Plot of errors of the model | Results|
