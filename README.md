Hello, I am Merry Semereab, a senior student at Zayed University. I have honed my skills in data science, data visualization and machine learning through hands-on projects in class and assignments.

In my portfolio, you'll find a selection of my most significant projects and I am proud of the impact these projects have had and the lessons I learned along the way.
Each sector takes to kaggle page where you can find the codes along with explanations and analysis.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/decision-tree-technique-using-the-diabetes-dataset" target="_blank"> Decision Tree Technique using the Diabetes dataset </a>
I used decision tree to determine whether the person has diabetes or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing. 
#### Code and Resources Used
* Language: R
* Packages used: caTools, FSelector, party
* Category: Classification

#### Results 
The model trained was almost 80% accurate. The accuracy was measured by a function that calculates the correct predictions from all test instances from the confusion matrix.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/random-forest-technique-using-the-heart-disease" target="_blank"> Random Forest Technique using the Heart Disease dataset </a>
I used random forest to determine whether the person has a high risk of cardiovascular disease or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing.
