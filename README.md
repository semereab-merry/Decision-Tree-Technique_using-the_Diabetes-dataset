Hello, I am Merry Semereab, a senior student at Zayed University. I have honed my skills in data science, data visualization and machine learning through hands-on projects in class and assignments.

In my portfolio, you'll find a selection of my most significant projects and I am proud of the impact these projects have had and the lessons I learned along the way.
Each sector takes to kaggle page where you can find the codes along with explanations and analysis.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/linearr-air-quality-dataset" target="_blank"> Linear Regression Technique using the Air Quality dataset </a>
I used linear regression to determine the temperature of a day given. The model is useful for predictions assist in weather forecast.

| **Language:** R <br> <br> **Packages used:** Amelia, caTools, corrplot, Metrics <br> <br> **Category:** Regression| <img width="1000"  alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59441158/216059847-1a3d330f-c1c9-4136-a550-8cc6f02e5281.png"> | The model trained has an error of 5.6.  <br> RMSE  (Root Mean Squared Error) error was used for this model.|


## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/decision-tree-technique-using-the-diabetes-dataset" target="_blank"> Decision Tree Technique using the Diabetes dataset </a>
I used decision tree to determine whether the person has diabetes or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/random-forest-technique-using-the-heart-disease" target="_blank"> Random Forest Technique using the Heart Disease dataset </a>
I used random forest to determine whether the person has a high risk of cardiovascular disease or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing.
