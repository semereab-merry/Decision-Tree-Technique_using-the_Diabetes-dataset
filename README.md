Hello, I am Merry Semereab, graduated from Zayed University. I have honed my skills in data science, data visualization and machine learning through hands-on projects.

In my portfolio, you'll find a selection of my most significant projects and I am proud of the impact these projects have had and the lessons I learned along the way.
Each sector takes to kaggle page where you can find the codes along with explanations and analysis.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/linearr-air-quality-dataset" target="_blank"> Weather Forecast and Air Quality using Linear Regression Technique </a>
I used linear regression to determine the temperature of a day given. The model is useful for predictions assist in weather forecast.

| **Language:** R <br> <br> **Packages used:** Amelia, caTools, corrplot, Metrics <br> <br> **Category:** Regression| <img width="1000"  alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59441158/216059847-1a3d330f-c1c9-4136-a550-8cc6f02e5281.png"> | The model trained has an error of 5.6.  <br> RMSE  (Root Mean Squared Error) error was used for this model.|


## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/decision-tree-technique-using-the-diabetes-dataset" target="_blank"> Diabetes Detection using Decision Tree Technique </a>
I used decision tree to determine whether the person has diabetes or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/random-forest-technique-using-the-heart-disease" target="_blank"> Heart Disease detection using Random Forest Technique </a>
I used random forest to determine whether the person has a high risk of cardiovascular disease or not. The model is useful for doctors to make a prediction and recommend the user on the best option for testing.

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/association-rule-happiness-dataset" target="_blank"> Happiness distribution analysis using Association Rule Technique </a>
I used an apriori model predict find the assosciation among services in a place to predict the likelyhood of considered a place happy. The model is useful for residents to make a prediction for better housing environment.

| **Language:** R <br> <br> **Packages used:** arules, arulesViz <br> <br> **Category:** Assosciation| <img width="1000"  alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59441158/216113690-1d52c4d7-8093-4902-8439-a7dd4c75e515.png"> | I built 2 models with a support of 0.05 and 0.04 and <br> a confidence level of 0.85 and 0.9 respectively.|


## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/text-analysis-donald-speech-in-dallas" target="_blank"> Analysis of Donald Trump Speech in Dallas using Text Mining and Analysis</a>
I used text analysis to create a word cloud that illustrates the main topics he mentioned in his speech.

| Code and Resources Used  | Word cloud | Results|
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| **Language:** R <br> <br> **Packages used:** dplyr, tidytext, stringr, wordcloud, knitr, DT, tidyr <br> <br> **Category:** Text mining and analysis| <img width="1000"  alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59441158/216144920-87c56661-cfd4-412a-a7c3-53b0f47b02a7.png"> | I created a word cloud and datatable for the speech.|

## <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/merryzeray/logistic-reg-breast-cancer-detection" target="_blank"> Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression </a>
I used logistic regression to determine if the diagnosis is M or B (malignant or benign) by analysing other physical attributions of the person.
