Hello, I am Merry Semereab, graduated from Zayed University. I have honed my skills in data science, data visualization and machine learning through hands-on projects.

In my portfolio, you'll find a selection of my most significant projects and I am proud of the impact these projects have had and the lessons I learned along the way.
Each sector takes to kaggle page where you can find the codes along with explanations and analysis.
